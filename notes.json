    "neutralised_chunk": "Event-driven architectures and event-based compute are distinct concepts that are often used together in serverless applications on AWS, but they are not the same thing.\n\nEvent-driven architectures involve decoupled, asynchronous processing of events across an application. In this architectural style, components of the system communicate by emitting and consuming events, rather than through direct method calls or shared memory. This approach promotes loose coupling, scalability, and flexibility, as components can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the entire system.\n\nOn the other hand, event-based compute refers to the execution model of AWS Lambda functions, where they are triggered by events rather than running continuously. Lambda functions are invoked in response to specific events, such as API calls, database updates, or file uploads, and they execute their code in a stateless, ephemeral environment. This event-driven execution model has significant implications for how code is written and how applications are designed in a serverless context.\n\nWhile event-driven architectures and event-based compute are often used together in serverless applications, they are separate concerns. An application can employ an event-driven architecture without necessarily using event-based compute (e.g., using message queues or event streams with traditional servers), and an application can use event-based compute without adopting a fully event-driven architecture (e.g., using Lambda functions for specific tasks but maintaining a more traditional, request-response flow for other parts of the system).\n\nThe patterns and practices used for event-driven architectures may not directly apply to event-based compute, and vice versa. Developers need to understand the nuances and implications of both concepts to effectively design and implement serverless applications on AWS.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "AWS Lambda is known as event-based compute, and it greatly affects the way you create codes and design the architecture of serverless applications. Many serverless apps utilize an event-driven structure, relying on the uncoupled, asynchronous processing of events throughout the application. Though event-driven architectures and event-based compute may seem similar and are often jointly applied in serverless AWS applications, they're distinct. Moreover, the methods used for one won't necessarily work if not using the other.\n\nEvent-driven architectures are popular nowadays. They're defined by services that communicate asynchronously through events, thus setting them apart from other architectural paradigms. \n\nIf you've used a front end client contacting a back-end GraphQL API, a backend service calling another service through a REST API or RPC, you've utilized the request-response pattern. This connection method is quite common from one client to a service, typified by a synchronous flow where the client waits for a full feedback from the service about the request's outcome. \n\nThe synchronous path is straightforward because you attain immediate remarks on what ensued with your request. But depending on synchronous communication might have drawbacks as well: it might lower the overall performance of your app, especially when dealing with slower tasks like sending emails or generating reports. The availability of your services reduces too. With asynchronous patterns, these hindrances lessen. The services can still communicate, but won't anticipate an instant response. \n\nThe downstream service takes its time to process the communication without holding up that of the upstream service. Although this contributes to issues soft debugging, eventual consistency and more, it minimizes the downsides of synchronous communication. Consult Talia Nassi's post on the benefits of transitioning to event-driven architectures to understand more about request-response versus event-driven.",

Service A does not have to wait for Service B's response to continue functioning. Instead, services broadcast events that other services can subscribe to and react upon as needed. This decouples producers from consumers, allowing services to process events on their own schedules. While this approach introduces challenges like debugging and eventual consistency, it reduces the downsides of synchronous communication where a service's downtime directly impacts dependent services. Event producers publish occurrences within their service, and event consumers subscribe to relevant events and update their state or trigger workflows accordingly. The producer does not know or care about the specific consumers, similar to a news broadcaster reporting events regardless of who is tuned in.",

This is comparable to standard message-driven models like SQS or RabbitMQ where a system component pushes a message into a queue for processing. While this too is asynchronous and similar to an event-driven system, there's a distinct disparity: in the message-driven model, the message is deliberately sent to a specific recipient. While this indirect communication through a queue aids in resiliency and expedient responses, a strong synchrony between message sender and receiver deviates this model from normal event-driven frame.\n\nDiscussing event-based compute:\n\nDefining features of event-based computation:\n\n- The life of a computational entity is intrinsically linked to an event being processed.\n- The computation cluster acts on one event at any given time.\n\nTo provide an understandable context, consider setting up a Lambda function. Post drafting code, storage to AWS after converting to a ZIP file, and defining RabbitMQ settings\u2014 none of this automatically activates your code, unlike similar configurations on EC2 or Fargate. So, despite structuring your Lambda function, no instances of operation exist yet as the function unrealized.\n\nLambda operations commence upon its integration with an external event source. Most commonly, API Gateway, SQS, EventBridge, and Kinesis/ DynamoDB Streams integrate with Lambda. laying out event origination and linking up functional services leads to the function's activation. Additionally, converted Lambda function instances process triggered events under your customization and recap the intended response to the event initiator.\n\nTo optimize, Lambda service may preserve function instances functional in case of several triggering events occurring within a brief span. The logistics of these operations are mostly inaccessible. Noteworthy: traditional function instances waiting upon request arrivals for processing their tasks or continually updating retrieval messages align differently from designated compute segments idly attending to a sole critical event. Even a Fargate role lineup contrasts against Lambda functions since their execution lacks any consciousness revolving around attribute triggering events.",

To put it plainly, having managed results between median and tail latency is more valuable than lowering median or p90 or p95 latency.\n### Abnormal distribution of user data\n\nThe key takeaway for the user is that we can only interact and deal with the consumers we have at hand, not those we aspire to work with. Ideally, users would exert consistent and forecasted traffic that evenly distributed data access across all sections of a table's key map. Yet, reality presents a different scenario. The initial Dynamo documentation discussed the use of constant hashing in data dissemination across individual divisions that are typically nearby 10GB in volume.

DynamoDB runs a fleet of storage nodes handling partitions from multiple user tables. A partition consists of three instances across availability zones, forming a replication group. One instance acts as the leader, handling writes by committing them locally and to at least one replica before responding to the client. This enhances durability in case of node failure.\n\nEach partition has a B-tree containing indexed data and a write-ahead log (WAL) storing ordered updates.

Here is a neutral version that preserves the core factual information:\n\nThe Serverless Framework and AWS CDK are both tools for defining and deploying serverless applications on AWS. They serve as pre-processors for AWS CloudFormation, but differ in their approach.\n\nThe Serverless Framework utilizes a declarative YAML configuration file called serverless.yml to describe the application. It has blocks for defining Lambda functions, event sources, and other AWS resources. The key abstraction is the functions block, which simplifies the process of creating Lambda functions and connecting them to event sources. This approach follows a 'convention over configuration' pattern.\n\nIn contrast, CDK applications involve a mixture of application code and infrastructure code within the same codebase. The infrastructure definitions are written in a programming language like TypeScript or Python. This approach requires developers to understand the team's specific implementation of the CDK, in addition to the CDK itself, which can make onboarding new developers more challenging.\n\nThe text highlights concerns around maintainability and developer knowledge transfer for CDK applications, as well as a preference for a more standardized structure provided by the Serverless Framework.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "Some individuals have raised concerns about the sustainability of CDK over time. There are potential issues such as lack of updates for constructs or not adhering to the CDK version updates. These problems are valid, but the larger problem seems to be the retention of developer knowledge relating to a particular CDK application. Bringing a new developer up-to-speed on your specific structure poses significant challenges. A new developer needs to not only understand CDK but also your team's unique use of CDK. This specialized knowledge remains concealed within your team and could potentially lead to elongated adjustment periods for new developers.\n\nTwo of the more challenging aspects of deploying serverless applications are: encapsulating your functions, and setting up the events that activate those functions. In this context, the Serverless Framework is appreciably more efficacious in its abstractions. Recognizing that functions and events are the backbones of serverless applications, the Serverless Framework has accentuated these two facets in their core abstraction.\n\nHere is an illustrative functions block taken from a serverless.yml file:\n\n```\nfunctions:\n  createUser:\n    handler: src/handlers/createUser.handler\n    events:\n      - http: POST /users\n  processQueue:\n    handler: src/handlers/processQueue.handler\n    events:\n      - sqs:\n          arn: !GetAtt [MyQueue, Arn]\n          batchSize: 10\n  fanout:\n    handler: src/handlers/fanout.handler\n    events:\n      - sns:\n          arn: !Ref MyTopic\n          topicName: MyTopic\n```\n\nExecuting the command `serverless deploy` prompts the serverless framework to compile and configure a function on AWS for each function listed in the functions block. This comprises createUser, processQueue, and fanout. For each function, the serverless framework auto-installs dependencies, conducts a build process, packs the directory, uploads it to S3, and establishes the function alongside its basic configuration with the Lambda service. All this takes place with minimal involvement on the user end, unless the user has special requirements.",

However, there is an admission to be made. In the previous section, the event configuration made using the Serverless Framework was presented as simpler than it actually is. In the SQS and SNS integrations, additional infrastructure is referenced, specifically an SQS queue and an SNS topic:\n\n```\nfunctions:\n  createUser:\n    handler: src/handlers/createUser.handler\n    events:\n      - http: POST /users\n  processQueue:\n    handler: src/handlers/processQueue.handler\n    events:\n      - sqs:\n          arn: !GetAtt [MyQueue, Arn]\n          batchSize: 10\n  fanout:\n    handler: src/handlers/fanout.handler\n    events:\n      - sns:\n          arn: !Ref MyTopic\n          topicName: MyTopic\n```\n\nWhilst the Serverless Framework considers functions and events as the main constituents of your serverless applications, it also acknowledges the necessity for further supporting infrastructure to achieve anything substantial. And so, the resources block of your serverless.yml comes into play.\n\nYou can include any additional AWS resource required directly via CloudFormation in this resources block. The resources block for our SQS- and SNS-functioning application would look as this:\n\n```\nresources:\n  MyQueue:\n    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue\n    Properties:\n      QueueName: my-queue\n\n  MyTopic:\n    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic\n    Properties:\n      TopicName: my-topic\n```\n\nThe appealing aspect of this is that you are effectively writing CloudFormation.

It will not offer a comprehensive deep dive into DynamoDB costs and for more detailed strategies on cost-saving patterns with DynamoDB, Khawaja Sham's extensive thread provides further information.\n\n## Understanding DynamoDB Pricing Practices\n\nThe cost structure of DynamoDB consists primarily of three major components. The service charges for read consumption, write consumption, and storage used. This model presents a foreseeable pattern of potential charges.\n\nUsers can get preoccupied with different pricing modes, such as on-demand versus provisioned, or table storage types such as Standard or Standard-IA. However, it is fundamental to understand that the primary cost components are read, write, and storage charges.\n\nThat foresight absolves the need for puzzlement over concerns like how many concurrent operations a db.m6gd.large instance can handle or how much data can fit in a 1TB gp3 storage volume, for example. It leaves the user to mainly focus on the cost impact of data read, data written, and storage consumed.\n\nA few nuances in the DynamoDB pricing structure are noteworthy. Read Capacity Units (RCUs) and Write Capacity Units (WCUs) are charged in increments. Any unused increments in these units are nonetheless chargeable. Strongly consistent read requests and eventually consistent read requests are available as choices for the user.

This is because each transaction requires two write operations, one for the prepare phase and another for the commit phase.\n\nThe text also highlights a few points about DynamoDB pricing:\n\n1. Read Capacity Units (RCUs) and WCUs are charged in increments, even if the full increment is not utilized.\n2. For read operations, there is a choice between strongly consistent reads and eventually consistent reads, with different pricing implications.\n3. DynamoDB Query allows reading multiple items in a single request.\n\nThe text then discusses the choice between provisioned and on-demand billing modes for DynamoDB. It suggests using on-demand billing for initial calculations, as it has a fixed price for reads and writes, making cost estimation simpler. However, for high-traffic workloads, provisioned capacity may be a worthwhile optimization, potentially saving up to 42% on costs compared to on-demand billing, assuming 50% utilization.\n\nThe trade-off is that with provisioned capacity, users are responsible for scaling up and down based on traffic patterns and handling unexpected spikes in traffic.

For instance, with a 1KB item size, each write would consume 1 Write Capacity Unit (WCU), resulting in a cost of $1.25 per million page views under on-demand billing. This pricing may or may not be acceptable, depending on the specific requirements.\n\nIf the underlying record is larger, such as 10KB, the cost would increase significantly, with each million page views costing $12.50.

Implementing a shopping cart for a single-page application with a regular REST backend could necessitate multiple calls to render the shopping cart page: one request to fetch the current items in the cart and numerous requests to gather up-to-date data about each item. This presents a multitude of problems, not least the dreaded N + 1 issue which ORMs can add extra strain on the database due to their inefficient queries. The same issue applies to single-page applications using a RESTful backend, where the frontend must issue numerous requests to properly display the page.\n\nAn added complexity is the sequencing of the requests - the individual item details cannot be fetched until the shopping cart content is retrieved, leading to a cascade of linked requests and a perceptible sluggishness of the application.\n\nGraphQL considerably mitigates this issue by allowing the frontend client to retrieve a complete data map with just a single request. A single GraphQL query can gather the contents of the shopping cart and the specific details of each item. As soon as this request completes, the page can be displayed without waiting for further requests. However, it should be noted that GraphQL doesn't necessarily entirely remove the N + 1 problem. It is possible that the issue could be shifted to the backend; though that doesn't belittle the fact that GraphQL successfully eliminates the frontend application and developer from bearing the problem.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "The application's performance appears to be hindered by a series of sequential requests, resulting in a sluggish user experience. GraphQL aims to address this issue by enabling a frontend client to make a single request that retrieves a graph of data. Within a single GraphQL query, it is possible to retrieve both the shopping cart and all of the items contained within it. Once this request is fulfilled, the entire page can be rendered without waiting for subsequent requests. However, it is important to note that GraphQL does not necessarily eliminate the N + 1 problem entirely. As will be discussed below, it could potentially shift the N + 1 problem to the backend. The primary advantage of GraphQL in this context is that it eliminates the N + 1 problem from the frontend application and developer's perspective.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "The GraphQL strategy involves letting out a schema that outlines the structure of your data. Clients are free to make any necessary requests against this schema, and the backend implementation of GraphQL will handle the assembly of the requisite data. Typically, frontend modifications do not necessitate backend changes, and the process can be as simple as reworking the GraphQL query relevant to a particular page to alter the required data. In general terms, GraphQL backends rely on separate, concentrated resolvers that obtain specific data components. This may generate N+1 question patterns on the backend. Consider our example of a shopping cart query:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  cart(username: \"alexdebrie\") {\n    id\n    lastUpdated\n    items {\n      id\n      quantity\n      name\n      sku\n      price\n}\n```\n## Points to Note\n\nObserving the above benefits, one conclusions that may be drawn is that GraphQL simplifies tasks for frontend developers. It allows them to be less careful about the returned data from an API. It eliminates the need for a cascade of network requests and the troubles with piecemeal errors. Importantly, they can make updates to the frontend without any backend support. The resolvers are so designed that they perform universally, regardless the initial query making it easy to format a response simply through feeding in a modified GraphQL query.\n\nThis underpins the higher level of GraphQL adoption among engineering teams that afford more influence to frontend developers. The concept itself is not erroneous. Most engineering teams inherently favor a specific kind of developer and optimize their systems accordingly. In my observation, REST API's simplify tasks for backend developers at the expense of making them more complex for clients, often these are the frontend developers.\n\n## Interaction between DynamoDB and GraphQL\n\nGaining more insights into the benefits of GraphQL, let's shift our focus to the interaction dynamics between DynamoDB and GraphQL. To start with, we need to know the fundamental facts about DynamoDB.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "Frontend developers can make changes without needing help from backend developers, due to the fact that resolvers are implemented in a versatile nature, detached from the initiating query. Altering the GraphQL query input easily reshapes responses. \n\nTypically, GraphQL is more widely used in engineering teams where there is more influence held by frontend developers. There is no fundamental problem with this situation. Most engineering teams lean towards a certain type of developer and will adjust their systems to suit that preference. It's my opinion that REST APIs make tasks considerably less complex for backend developers. They offload a lot of the intricacies towards clients, which are often frontend developers, by reducing the data quantity within each specific request.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "The text discusses several aspects of GraphQL and DynamoDB. Regarding GraphQL, it highlights how the resolvers are implemented generically, independent of the originating query, allowing for easy reshaping of responses by modifying the GraphQL query input. It notes that this has led to more GraphQL adoption among engineering teams where frontend developers have a stronger influence, as it simplifies data handling for them compared to REST APIs, which can make life easier for backend developers by limiting the amount of data per request.\n\nMoving on to DynamoDB, the text provides background information on this NoSQL database from AWS. It emphasizes DynamoDB's optimization for extreme predictability and consistency of performance, achieved by restricting how it can be used and enforcing the use of a primary key for most access patterns. This primary key structure, combined with the lack of features like JOINs and aggregations across multiple records, ensures single-digit millisecond response times on individual items, regardless of database size.\n\nThe text further explains that DynamoDB has clear, strict limits, such as a maximum item size of 400KB and a limit on the number of concurrent reads and writes against a subset of data. These limitations are in place to maintain consistency and predictability, turning performance into a binary decision of success or failure rather than allowing for slowly degrading application performance under load.\n\nDue to these choices made by the DynamoDB team, data modeling in DynamoDB differs from relational databases. Instead of designing data in an abstract, normalized way and then implementing queries, DynamoDB requires considering access patterns first and designing the table accordingly. This often results in denormalized data structures tailored to specific requirements.\n\nThe text introduces the concept of single-table design, where related data is assembled in a single DynamoDB table to avoid multiple requests and the N+1 problem. By using a Query operation, both the repository and the issue items can be fetched in a single request, turning an N+1 query into a single query without the CPU overhead of a SQL join operation.",
