    "neutralised_chunk": "Securing CI/CD roles is a crucial aspect of maintaining a secure and reliable deployment process. While using dedicated CI/CD roles and identity federation mitigates the risk of compromised credentials, supply chain attacks remain a concern. Attackers can potentially compromise dependencies such as Docker images or static analysis tools used in the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThe question of how to properly limit the permissions of CI/CD roles is a common one. The principle of least privilege suggests restricting the role's permissions to only what is necessary. Two common approaches are:\n\n1. Starting with a blank slate and incrementally adding permissions until the application can be deployed successfully. This approach is time-consuming and laborious.\n\n2. Starting with the AdministratorAccess policy, allowing the role broad permissions. Then, using CloudTrail to track the actions performed by the role over time and creating a tailored set of IAM permissions based on the CloudTrail data.\n\nBoth approaches have significant drawbacks in the long run. The first approach is tedious and may lead to incomplete permissions, causing deployment failures. The second approach, while initially convenient, can result in excessive permissions being granted to the CI/CD role, increasing the potential impact of a compromised pipeline.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "Your text raises valid concerns regarding the challenges of implementing the principle of least privilege for CI/CD roles in AWS. Here is a neutral summary:\n\nGranting appropriate permissions to a CI/CD role is a delicate balance between security and functionality. The principle of least privilege recommends starting with minimal permissions and adding only necessary ones. However, this approach can be time-consuming and prone to overlooking required permissions, leading to deployment failures and rollback issues.\n\nAn alternative is to start with broad administrative access, monitor the role's actions via CloudTrail, and then create a tailored permission set. While more permissive initially, this method aims to capture all required permissions upfront.\n\nBoth approaches have drawbacks. The least privilege method requires meticulous analysis and may still miss permissions needed for rollbacks. The broad access method introduces potential security risks during the monitoring period.\n\nUltimately, granting CI/CD role permissions requires careful consideration of security best practices, deployment requirements, and the trade-offs between the two approaches. Thorough testing and monitoring are crucial to ensure the role has the necessary permissions while minimizing excessive privileges.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "Neutral text:\n\n- CloudFormation rollbacks might emerge as a surprise, especially for people who don't write CloudFormation templates. When deployment failure occurs the first time, you might realize many permissions in the CI/CD role are missing. This often leaves your stack in a 'ROLLBACK_FAILED' state and won't resolve until you fix these missing permissions. Therefore, creating a least privileged CI/CD role may need more effort than expected as it also includes permissions for rollbacks.\n\n- Keep in mind that your architecture is never constant. It evolves along with your application and business needs. So, when you include a new service, you'll have to revise the CI/CD role as well. Whether it is starting using OpenSearch or Bedrock, you'll need to update the CI/CD role before anything else. This can be time-consuming, especially in organizations where the application team doesn't manage the CI/CD role. This back-and-forth often results in productivity loss. The process repeats for every new service because each has its separate CI/CD pipeline. It creates ongoing challenges to productivity, stifles innovation, and slows down the inclusion of new services to the tech stack. After all, using a new service implies new CI/CD permissions which may lead to dealing with lots of red tape.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "The passage discusses the risks associated with compromised CI/CD pipelines and the challenges of implementing a least privileged approach. It then proposes an alternative approach to securing CI/CD pipelines by using separate AWS accounts for different environments and teams. The key points are:\n\n1. If an attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline, they can potentially create IAM roles and Lambda functions to carry out malicious activities, making a least privileged CI/CD role insufficient to mitigate risks.\n\n2. Implementing permission boundaries to limit the CI/CD role's capabilities requires significant effort and can be challenging to implement correctly.\n\n3. Instead of pursuing a least privileged CI/CD role, the author suggests using separate AWS accounts for each environment (e.g., development, production) to isolate potential compromises.\n\n4. For large organizations, it is recommended to have at least one account per team per environment to further insulate teams from each other's mistakes.\n\n5. For business-critical systems, it is advisable to have a dedicated account per service per environment to provide an additional layer of protection.\n\nThe passage argues that separating environments and teams into distinct AWS accounts can effectively contain the impact of a compromised CI/CD pipeline, reducing the need for complex and potentially error-prone permission management within a single account.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "Different environments are separated by an isolating barrier. If one part becomes vulnerable, it is restrained to that area by the account barrier. In other words, if a hacker finds a vulnerability in your development environment, they will not be able to penetrate your production data.\nFor larger corporations, it may be beneficial to go even further. It is advisable to have at least one account for each separate team for each environment. In this way, teams would not be affected by the errors of other groups.\nFor systems critical to the running of the business, they should also have standalone accounts. This indicates one account for each service in each environment. While this is not mandatory, it is helpful in safeguarding these critical systems against flaws in other parts of the system.\n## Service Control Policies (SCPs)\n\nMake use of SCPs to restrict access to idle resources. These comprehensive limitations include opportunities to block access to unused Amazon Web Services (AWS) foregrounds and non-working services. This could potentially remove major parts of AWS as possible areas for attack.\nIf you are not currently governing any virtual computing environments, disallow all activities related to this. This would be one less potential spot for crypto-jacking attacks. Nonetheless, EC2 Container Service (ECS) has become the latest area for crypto-jacking. If complete disabling of ECS is not an option, the least action to take would be to restrict entry to regions where there are no containers at hand.\n## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)\n\nThe implementation of ABAC is steadily improving its status, in spite of its present middling standard. Having said that, numerous services do already accept the `aws:ResourceTag/${TagKey}` and `aws:PrincipalTag/${TagKey}` circumstances. Use these conditions to hinder attackers from gaining access to and developing resources. Attach these to the identity access management (IAM) permissions of the CI/CD position. Alternatively, use these as a checkpoint enacted through a scope limitation.\nThe mentioned conditions will function best when the CI/CD role is prohibited from inquiring about itself. Only in this way can hackers not discover which markers the CI/CD role has and which markers they need to produce new resources. This helps prevent an attacker from infiltrating our resources via the CI/CD role. Nevertheless, attackers may turn to the services below to utilise harmful code or assert an elevated level of threats:\n - Lambda\n - EC2\n - ECS\n - IAM\n - CodePipeline\n - CloudFormation\nOn the bright side, all of these services, along with many others, value the `aws:ResourceTag/${TagKey}` condition. We should use this condition as a protective shield, preventing the attacker from producing any new resources.",

    "neutralised_chunk": "The effectiveness of these rules can be optimised through a permission boundary. The CI/CD role should be restricted from acquiring knowledge about itself for maximising security measures. This preventive measure ensures that an external invader cannot access information regarding the tags attached to the CI/CD role or ascertain the necessary course of action to generate new resources.\n\nBy doing so, blocking user access to bank resources via the CI/CD role becomes less challenging. Potential targets for malicious activity or privileging escalation could include several services, encompassing the likes of Lamba, EC2, ECS, IAM, Code, Pipeline, or CloudFormation. Fortunately, all these services, among others, extend support for the `aws:ResourceTag/${TagKey}` condition, leveraging this condition to prevent the devised course of action by malicious intruders.\n\n## Implementing a Permissive CI/CD Role\n\nUpon executing the aforementioned tips, it is confirmed that\n\n- The vulnerability surface associated with unused services or regions has been eliminated.\n- The compromising 'blast radius' has been minimally confined to individual teams and services.\n- Making the CI/CD role susceptible to misuse by attackers has been made considerably difficult by enforcing the requirement of legitimate tags on resources. The Intruder is hence unable to decipher this easily given the inaccessibility to describe the CI/CD service as a whole.\n  \nWe are hence under the allowance of garnering a more permissive CI/CID role, while negating challenges in creation or maintenance. it's secure and difficult to exploit, and maintains a limit on actual execution power.\n\nWith the term 'permissive', the intent is not definitively 'AdministratorAccess'. However, it does encourage a level of autonomous control. You can extend broad write and read permissions to all the active services, effortlessly, not necessarily having to specifically highlight the actions you merely require!",
