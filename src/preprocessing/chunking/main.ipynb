      "This article is part of a series on Lift, an open-source project that simplifies deploying serverless applications. As introduced in previous articles, Lift is a Serverless Framework plugin that simplifies deploying serverless applications. At some point, every application needs to interact with an ecosystem of 3rd party SaaS providers. Implementing a webhook HTTP endpoint in your application allows this ecosystem of external applications to notify you. Your application can then react to those notifications and perform tasks accordingly. As we approach the first beta planned in the next weeks, let’s deep dive about Lift’s 4th component, webhooks: How to deploy production-ready HTTP webhook endpoints. How we plan to simplify that with Lift.\n",

      "The naive approach, while working, lacks some important criterion to maximize its efficiency. 3rd party apps notifiers expect your webhook endpoints to be available, respond fast and acknowledge all notifications. In order to do so, you should keep in mind: Transport / Processing separation of concerns: Webhooks are an inter-system notification medium based on HTTP transport. Acknowledging messages (authenticating, validating and parsing) and processing them are two different tasks: they should be done separately. As long as the message is acknowledged, our API should always return a 200 response. The response code should not depend on the ability of the application to use the notification content to perform some actions. Asynchronous decoupling: Webhooks are by nature an asynchronous notification protocol. A good webhook design should not put excessive stress on your application when the quantity of notification increases. A decoupling service (like a queue or a bus) should be implemented between the acknowledging and the processing workloads. Cost optimized: Webhook endpoints absorb a various range of notification types. Your application might not want to actually do something for all of those types. It is therefore a good practice to ensure all of your infrastructure is not invoked for all incoming webhooks. Doing so, you’ll reduce the risk of Denial of Wallet and be able to implement easily application filtering to process only the notification types you want. Error management: Processing errors should not bubble up back to the notifier thanks to Transport/Processing separation of concern. However, some mechanism should be in place to ensure unprocessable messages are not lost forever. Monitoring: You should be notified of an excessive amount of notification you cannot authorize. This could either be a malicious attack on your endpoint or a wrong configuration of the secret used to check notification signature.\n",
