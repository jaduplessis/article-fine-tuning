The key requirements were swift production release to address system failures from increased traffic, ability to scale to 250,000 chat participants per video event, and enabling the existing development team to maintain and iterate the chat system.\n\nThe chat application needed real-time user communication functionality, for which websockets were chosen over long-polling due to cost-efficiency and performance advantages at scale. AWS AppSync, a managed serverless GraphQL interface for various data sources, was selected to meet the requirements for rapid delivery, scalability, and ease of use. API Gateway websockets were considered but deemed unsuitable due to lack of mass message broadcast capability. AppSync's GraphQL interface also facilitated rapid frontend development.</YourResponse>",

API Gateway websockets were also contemplated, but owing to our requisites for mass broadcast of messages, it was not a viable option (there exists no mechanism to broadcast messages to all connected clients with one API call \u2014 an API call per connection is necessitated). Additionally, the GraphQL interface of AppSync permits rapid frontend development.\n\n## Architecture\nThis simple architecture enabled the expeditious delivery of our chat application while also presenting a clear set of technologies that would need to be imparted to the existing team.\n\nThe architecture is predicated upon AppSync, which integrates with Cognito user pools for our authentication. DynamoDB is also leveraged as our data source (peruse information regarding DynamoDB in the succeeding section).\n\nAll of this integrates with our React frontend which utilizes the Apollo Client to effectuate our requests to the GraphQL server from the frontend. Note, the Serverless Framework was utilized to manage the IaC (infrastructure as code), while amplify simply provided the SDK for frontend interaction with backend deployed services.\n</YourResponse>",

This approach involves calling a single endpoint instead of separate defined endpoints.\n\nThe example mentions that certain operations are similar to POST requests. These operations are used to modify data.\n\nThe provided code demonstrates setting up an operation to add data with specific arguments to a database table.

Mutations are utilized for modifying data.\n\nThe code snippet illustrates how a sendMessage mutation is set up \u2014 the roomId and message are passed in as arguments, allowing the addition of the message along with that information as an item to the DynamoDB table. The return type is a Message.\n\nApache VTL is used for the business logic. To communicate with the data source, resolvers are required \u2014 these facilitate the connection between GraphQL and the data source. The resolvers are written in Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL), which takes the request as input and outputs a JSON document.\n\nIn certain cases, multiple operations may be necessary to resolve the GraphQL field \u2014 in such instances, a feature of AppSync called pipeline resolvers is employed. Pipeline resolvers consist of a 'before' mapping template, followed by a number of functions, and concluding with an 'after' mapping template.\n\nAs an example, a pipeline resolver is utilized for starting a thread on a question. To make use of single table design, there are 'MESSAGE' rows and 'THREAD' rows. When a person replies in a thread, a THREAD row needs to be added and the MESSAGE row needs to be mutated to include a 'repliedAt' timestamp. This requires two separate requests.\n</YourResponse>",

    "neutralised_chunk": "<YourResponse>\n\nIn accordance with the prescribed legal parlance, the following elucidation is proffered regarding the aforementioned subject matter:\n\nOccasionaly, it may become necessitous to execute a multiplicity of operations in order to effectuate the resolution of a GraphQL field. In such instances, a salubrious feature of AppSync, denominated as \"pipeline resolvers,\" shall be utilized. Pipeline resolvers consist of an antecedent mapping template, succeeded by a multiplicity of functions, and culminating with a posterior mapping template.\n\nBy way of exemplification, a pipeline resolver is employed for the initiation of a thread on a query. To avail the benefits of single table design, we have rows designated as 'MESSAGE' and rows denominated as 'THREAD.' When a person proffers a reply within a thread, it becomes incumbent upon us to append a THREAD row and mutate the MESSAGE row to incorporate a 'repliedAt' timestamp. This process necessitates two discrete requests.\n\nRegarding the frontend, we utilize the AWS Amplify SDK in conjunction with Cognito for the purpose of authenticating our users. Amplify furnishes pre-constructed UI components to cater for sign-in and sign-out functionalities. We configure the authentication by employing 'Auth' from aws-amplify and utilizing our user pool information (from the Cognito user pool deployed by the Serverless Framework). To effectuate requests from the frontend, we engage the Apollo Client, which is our preferred instrumentality for interacting with our backend, as it is compatible with TypeScript, provides a propitious developer experience, and manages state in the frontend by means of a caching mechanism.\n\n</YourResponse>",
