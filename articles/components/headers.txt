## Summary
## The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a framework that lets you define your Cloud Application resources using familiar programming languages such as TypeScript or Python. This allows developers familiar with these languages to apply their existing knowledge and get to grips with building Cloud infrastructure rapidly. By using provided high-level components, built with best practices as default, we can abstract much of the complexity away from the developer, and by encapsulating resources into constructs we can continue this practice as our resources scale in size and complexity.

## The missing characteristics of a good webhook design
## A production-ready approach
### Production-ready serverless webhook endpoint architecture
# serverless.yml
# ...
# You can use native Serverless framework functionalities to define your processors
# But you need raw Cloudformation to define API Gateway integration to EventBridge
